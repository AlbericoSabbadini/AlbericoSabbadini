Hi there! I'm Albe. I'm interested in all sort of things, 
but on github you can expect to find the projects I'm working on my own to practice data science/engineering and machine learning. 
It's not impossible that some small videogame will appear around here too.

If you want to get in touch, feel free to drop me an email at a. sabbadini @hotmail.it
